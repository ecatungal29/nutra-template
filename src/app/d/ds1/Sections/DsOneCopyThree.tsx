        And after listening to feedback from thousands of our delighted customers,
        I know two things:

        1. Once you&apos;ve been taking ProstaFlow for a while, you&apos;ll be amazed by its incredible power. So I have every reason to believe you&apos;ll want to order more in the future... But the last thing you want is to run out of ProstaFlow and come back to this website, only to find that we&apos;re out of stock! This happens when ProstaFlow&apos;s more difficult-to-source ingredients are not available and our manufacturing facility has to wait on a new shipment. This is why I&apos;m urging you to stock up now and why I&apos;m practically giving you this extra 60-day (2-bottle) supply.

        2. I also know that when you finish your supply of ProstaFlow, you&apos;ll be so thrilled with your progress that you&apos;ll want to race back to this website and order more. But even if we do have bottles in stock, there&apos;s a good possibility that the price will be significantly higher. This is because the prices of some ingredients can go up without warning, which forces us to charge more. Also, you&apos;re getting free shipping on this order, but we won&apos;t be continuing this much longer. The next time you come back, on top of the higher prices per bottle, we&apos;ll probably need to ask you to pay for shipping as well. These are some of the reasons why our smartest customers decide to load up nowâ€¦ And there&apos;s ANOTHER huge reason to claim this amazing upgrade...
