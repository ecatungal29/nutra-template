            <h1 className="text-2xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-center mb-8  mx-4">
                And after listening to feedback from thousands of our delighted
                customers, I know two things:
            </h1>

            <p className="md:text-xl text-base text-left  mb-10 mx-3">
                <span className=" text-red-700 font-bold mr-1">
                    1. Once you&apos;ve been taking ProstaFlow for a while,
                    you&apos;ll be amazed by its incredible power.
                </span>
                So I have every reason to believe you&apos;ll want to order more
                in the future... But the last thing you want is to run out of
                ProstaFlow and come back to this website, only to find that
                we&apos;re out of stock! This happens when ProstaFlow&apos;s
                more difficult-to-source ingredients are not available and our
                manufacturing facility has to wait on a new shipment. This is
                why I&apos;m urging you to stock up now and why I&apos;m
                practically giving you this extra 90-day (3-bottle) supply.
            </p>

            <p className="md:text-xl text-base text-left  mb-10 mx-3">
                <span className=" text-red-700 font-bold mr-1">
                    2. I also know that when you finish your supply of
                    ProstaFlow, you&apos;ll be so thrilled with your progress
                    that you&apos;ll want to race back to this website and order
                    more. But even if we do have bottles in stock, there&apos;s
                    a good possibility that the price will be significantly
                    higher.
                </span>
                This is because the prices of some ingredients can go up without
                warning, which forces us to charge more. Also, you&apos;re
                getting free shipping on this order, but we won&apos;t be
                continuing this much longer. The next time you come back, on top
                of the higher prices per bottle, we&apos;ll probably need to ask
                you to pay for shipping as well. These are some of the reasons
                why our smartest customers decide to load up nowâ€¦ And
                there&apos;s ANOTHER huge reason to claim this amazing
                upgrade...
