                Due to high order volume a customer&apos;s order goes directly
                into our fulfillment center to be processed. If the customer
                contacts within 24 hours after they purchased they can cancel
                their order. If the customer contacts after 24 hours of purchase
                time then they will not be able to cancel their order. If your
                order is already processed or has already shipped, we cannot
                cancel the order. Customers will need to either refuse the
                package and immediately notify support@getprostaflow.com the
                date it was refused or return the package with a valid tracking
                number and notify us with said tracking number so we can verify.
                Once we receive the package back to our warehouse and review we
                will be able to provide a refund.

                It is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure that he or

                has entered. If your order is already processed or has already
                shipped, we cannot change the address and the only thing we can
